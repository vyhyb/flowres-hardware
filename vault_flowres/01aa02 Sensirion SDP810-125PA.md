# Sensirion SDP810-125PA

![[Attachments/01aa02 Sensirion SDP810-125PA.png|300]]

A [[01aa Digital differential pressure sensors|digital differential pressure sensor]], successor of the [[01aa01 Sensirion SDP610-25PA]].

It is interfaced using I2C protocol, which is rather straight forward on [[04ab RaspberryPi GPIO header utilization|Raspberry Pi SBCs]].

Priced at approx. â‚¬30 ([farnell](https://cz.farnell.com/sensirion/sdp810-125pa/pressure-sensor-diff-125pa-digital/dp/2886665)).

## Characteristics

- measurement range: -125 to 125 Pa
- zero-point accuracy: 0.08 Pa
- accuracy: 3% of reading

This means it is a **cheaper**, more or **similarly accurate** product compared to [[01aa01 Sensirion SDP610-25PA]], which is also suitable for a **wider pressure range**.

## Minimal code example

Given the [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/). Should be debugged for later use.

```python
import smbus
import time

class SDP810:
    # Default I2C address for SDP810
    DEFAULT_ADDRESS = 0x25  # Note: SDP810 default address is 0x25 (may vary by variant)

            data = self.bus.read_i2c_block_data(self.address, 0x00, 3)
            
            # Convert the data
            raw_pressure = (data[0] << 8) | data[1]

            # See datasheet for details

            return None
    
    def __del__(self):
        """Clean up when object is deleted."""
        try:
            self.stop_measurement()
        except:
            pass

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":

    try:

            if pressure is not None:
