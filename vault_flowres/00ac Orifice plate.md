# Orifice plate

Combining a 3D printed orifice and a [[01aa Digital differential pressure sensors|digital differential pressure sensor]], one could design a flow meter specifically tailored for flow resistivity measurements. Such design would need an extra step in terms of calibration, but could be potentially interesting to try. Calibration could be done using a known flow rate meter, such as one of the [[00aa Analog flow sensors]].
The problematic part is typically a large pressure drop across the orifice.
