# Flowres - Hardware

This vault serves as a knowledge base for the hardware of the mostly printed flow resistivity measurement setup. The outline of the vault is given in [Navigation](00_Navigation.md).

$$\sqrt{\frac{dfs}{fds}dfs^2 \mu}$$

The 3D printed parts are modelled in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), a free and open-source
parametric 3D CAD software. The models are stored in the `models` directory of the [`flowres-hardware`](https://www.github.com/vyhyb/flowres-hardware) repository on GitHub

The software part of the project can be found [here](https://www.github.com/vyhyb/flowres).

This vault is exported as a website and can be viewed [here](https://vyhyb.github.io/flowres-hardware/).
