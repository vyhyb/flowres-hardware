# Analog flow sensors

This type of sensors needs to be interfaced through an additional layer of [[04aa Analog to digital conversion|analog-to-digital converter]], which gives voltage readings later translated into the physical flow rate values.

In terms of the [[target flow rates]], there few options, which would not bee too expensive:
