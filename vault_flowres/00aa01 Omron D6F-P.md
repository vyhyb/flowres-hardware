# Omron D6F-P

An analog [[00aa Analog flow sensors|flow sensor]].

There are two main variants:
- 0 - 0.1 l/min
- 0 - 1 l/min

Given the general [[ISO 9053-1 Requirements]], both can be a reasonable option based on the specimen surface area of choice.

Both variants can be bought for approx. â‚¬40 at [Mouser](https://cz.mouser.com/c/?marcom=115753066) and probably also elsewhere.
