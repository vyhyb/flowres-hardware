# Omron D6F-P

An analog [[00aa Analog flow sensors|flow sensor]].

There are two main variants:
- 0 - 0.1 l/min
- 0 - 1 l/min

Given the general [[ISO 9053-1 Requirements]], both can be a reasonable option based on the specimen surface area of choice.

Both variants can be bought for approx. â‚¬40 at [Mouser](https://cz.mouser.com/c/?marcom=115753066) and probably also elsewhere.

The flow sensor depends on the dimensions (The target flow speed across the specimen is 0.5 mm/s, while the sensors are typically volumetric or mass based). For square samples, the target flow rate would be:
- 102 mm side - 0.3 l/min
- 45 mm side - 0.06 l/min
Given the 5% FS accuracy, the 0-1 l/min variant gives the error of $\pm 0.05 \;\mathrm{l/min}$, which is already probably too much for the
