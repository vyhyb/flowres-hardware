# Omron D6F-A3

![[Attachments/00aa01 Omron D6F-P picture.png|300]]

An analog [[00aa Analog flow sensors|flow sensor]]. An alternative to [[00aa01 Omron D6F-P]] for higher flow rates.

The flow rate range is 0-3 l/min. It is powered with 12 V.

This could be a valid option for measurements outside the range recommended by [[ISO 9053-1 Requirements]] or for larger sample sizes.

The price for this unit is around €170 on [Mouser](https://cz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Omron-Electronics/D6F-03A3-000?qs=93uzuGORGqeobncO0atalw%3D%3D)

Note that such sensor needs to be paired with a decent [ADC](app://obsidian.md/04aa%20Analog%20to%20digital%20conversion).
